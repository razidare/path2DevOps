In a nutshell, it is a set of "microservices" that started as a joke which are now used to showcase different devOps processes applied to the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC)

It's an emulation of what DevOps practices might look like, when focused around the __*barbArt*__ set of applications. The purpose of this series is to showcase an end-to-end project from the perspective of an engineer who would have to implement DevOps practices at their workplace.
When I started my journey, I could find a lot of available material on each individual technology, but little guidance on how to orchestrate them as a whole.
Because of this, I plan to showcase a possible scenario that you can follow along and get more familiar to DevOps.
